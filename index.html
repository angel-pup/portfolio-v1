                <p>Come one, come all and welcome to my personal portfolio page (WIP)!
                    I'm currently doing my best to learn more and more about full stack web development through the
                    guidance of the University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp. One of these days, I hope that my life
                    revolves more fully around code, for both work and hobbies. I just love the functionality and
                    life I can breathe into existence with the help of code. Hopefully there will be plenty more
                    examples of my work found below regarding these future prospects!<br> <br>

                    Beyond code, I've also found a love for good food and wish to someday be a skilled chef as well.
                    I have three dogs with my two roommates (Gunther the Dachshund, Prismo the "Golden Doxie", and
                    Buddy the Mountain Dog). They are all so sweet and wonderful and I love them very much. I also
                    love playing video games when I have time, hitting the gym, personal health/hygiene/self-care, and
                    meeting new people! I hope to maintain this lifestyle, possibly move to Amsterdam, and become
                    prestigious in my life and through my studies :)

                        <p>This is a website I deployed with guidance from the University of Kansas. It lightly
                            utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a prerequisite for our coding bootcamp.
                            Within the code, you'll find note cards with some of the notes I took at the time.</p>

                        <p>This was one of the coding challenges from the very same KU bootcamp, a simple and fun rock
                            paper scissors project! I went a bit over the top the first time though and found a way to
                            utilize some RNG manipulation lol.</p>

                        <p>This one is a bit harder to explain, but it was a project I did for my Introduction to
                            Microprocessors course at LA Tech. It simulates motor control via a potentiometer and
                            pulse width modulation, written in C on a FPGA. Feel free to take a look at the code, but
                            it may be easier to do so with the appropriate manual >.> (it currently only links to a
                            GitHub entry for it).</p>

                            eventually it will be a wonderful tool for tracking tournament progress for MTG
                            competitions (doing this as a gift for friends back home ^.^).</p>
